We didn't manage to merge the back end to any of the front end, but our API works!! :D

Marjor challenges:
-Getting SLQite to work
-Getting the database to seed correctly
-Getting any api call to work
-Getting a token back when attempting to log in
-Getting a list of the children back (that one was because when we deleted half of the 
dummy data temp, we forgot to make sure they were both role1 and role2, instead of both being role2)
-Deploying the front end that we did have on Azure
-Merging the front end and the back end together
